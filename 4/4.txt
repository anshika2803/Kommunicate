My internship at a company where I freelanced in the creation of an educational 
platform that had three types of login (administrator, student, and teacher) and
 gave a fully featured website for all of the tests and lesson preparation was,
  by far, the best project I have ever worked on.
   The website provided a place for all of the students
    and teachers to prepare for their lessons.
     It utilised Springboot Java REST API for receiving and storing dynamic data.
      React JS was used for the frontend, 
    while React Native was used for the remaining backend activities.
     MySQL served as the storage medium for the database.
