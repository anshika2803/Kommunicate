If I were to create a software firm, I would most likely hire two of 
my friends, Suritam Nandy and Arkaprava Chakraborty, who have been a 
consistent source of encouragement throughout each hackathon assignment or 
training session. When launching any business, what you need in individuals 
is trust and coordination, which these folks have. 
So I would consider myself really fortunate
to have chosen these two gentlemen as partners in a new enterprise.
